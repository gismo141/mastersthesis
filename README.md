## What is fastQDA?
The aim of this project is to create an open-source alternative to the market leader MaxQDA. Written in C++ and Qt it is possible to use fastQDA on almost every plattform from mobile to desktop.

FastQDA is a 3-pane window which enables the user to interact freely with his code- and document-database and his active document in the center of the application. Each code can be colorized and represents the markercolor for the documents.

Each code consits of a name, a definition, an example (called the anchor), its representing color and its headcode. The code is identified with its unique name. Each settings is adjustable via the 'settings-dialog'.

With the usage of Qt it is possible to create an user-experience that matches the operating-systems style. It is not needed to have a special design for every plattform because everything is already provided by the Qt-framework.

## Usage notes

At the time of writing the developement is made under Mac OS X with Sublime Text 3 and QtCreator for debugging-purpose. The backend for text-coding is made with the xpdf-toolchain which is freely available.

## Installation

To build fastQDA you need:

- `homebrew` (package manager for Mac OS X)
- `CMake` (build-system generator)
- `Qt5` (ui-libraries)
- [`Poppler` (pdf-rendering-library)](http://poppler.freedesktop.org)

### 1. Download the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gismo141/fastQDA
cd fastQDA
```

### 2. [Install `homebrew`](http://brew.sh)

### 3. Install `CMake`

```bash
brew install cmake
```

### 4. Install `Qt5`

```bash
brew install qt5
```

Because `Qt4` is still used in many other projects, `brew` does not link the `Qt5` binaries automatically. You can do this manually by adding the path to your `.bash_profile`:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt5/bin:$PATH
```

### 5. Install `Poppler`

```bash
brew install poppler.rb --with-qt5
```

### 6. Compile `fastQDA`

```bash
mkdir build # create the build-folder (holds the binaries)
cd build    # enter the build-folder
cmake ..    # prepare the build system
make        # compile the prepared files
```

If everything worked, you will now have the binary in your `build`-folder.
